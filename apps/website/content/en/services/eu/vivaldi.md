Vivaldi is a feature-rich, privacy-focused web browser developed by Vivaldi Technologies, a Norwegian company founded in 2016 by Jon von Tetzchner (co-founder of Opera) and Tatsuki Tomita. Born from a desire to create "Opera as it should have been," Vivaldi was designed specifically for power users who demand complete control over their browsing experience. The browser challenges the trend of simplification in modern browsers by offering unprecedented customization options and built-in productivity tools. Operating under Norway's strict data protection laws and employee-owned with no external investors, Vivaldi prioritizes user interests over profit maximization.

## Key Features

Vivaldi stands out with its philosophy that users shouldn't need browser extensions because everything is built-in. The browser features comprehensive tab management tools including tab stacking, hibernation for resource management, split-screen viewing, and session saving for organized workflows. Users can customize virtually every aspect of the interface, from theme colors that adapt to websites, to toolbar positioning, keyboard shortcuts, and mouse gestures for efficient navigation.

The browser includes a full-featured email client with IMAP and POP3 support, a flexible calendar for event management, and an algorithm-free feed reader for private news consumption. Additional productivity features include built-in note-taking with web panel integration, screenshot tools, webpage translation, floating video windows for multitasking, and a universal search tool called Quick Commands. Recently, Vivaldi became the first major browser to integrate Proton VPN directly, offering users enhanced privacy protection from two trusted European companies.

Vivaldi's commitment to user productivity extends to workspaces for organizing tab groups by project, side panels for quick access to frequently used websites, and the ability to share browser installations across multiple user profiles while maintaining individual customizations.

## Privacy and Security

Vivaldi takes a "privacy by design" approach, ensuring user privacy is protected by default without requiring configuration. The browser includes built-in ad and tracker blockers that not only protect privacy but also improve page loading speeds and reduce data consumption. Unlike many mainstream browsers, Vivaldi does not profile user behavior, collect personal data for advertising purposes, or sell user information to third parties.

The company operates under Norwegian data protection laws, which exceed GDPR requirements, and has undergone scrutiny from Datatilsynet, Norway's Data Protection Authority, ensuring compliance with Europe's strictest privacy standards. User data including browsing history and downloads are stored locally on devices in encrypted format, meaning even Vivaldi's own team cannot access this information. The browser's sync service uses end-to-end encryption to protect data when synchronized across devices.

Vivaldi's servers are located in Iceland for additional privacy protection, and the company maintains complete transparency about its data handling practices. As an employee-owned company with no external investors, Vivaldi has no commercial pressure to compromise user privacy for profit, allowing the company to maintain its user-first philosophy.

## Why Choose Vivaldi?

- **European Privacy Standards**: Norwegian company operating under some of the world's strictest data protection laws, fully GDPR compliant with transparent privacy practices
- **Complete Customization Control**: Unprecedented ability to personalize every aspect of the browser interface and functionality to match individual workflows and preferences
- **Built-in Productivity Suite**: Comprehensive tools including email, calendar, notes, and feed reader eliminate the need for multiple applications or browser extensions
- **Employee-Owned Independence**: No external investors means decisions are made based on user needs rather than profit maximization or data harvesting
- **Advanced Privacy Protection**: Built-in ad/tracker blocking, Proton VPN integration, and local data storage with encryption ensure maximum privacy protection
- **Power User Focus**: Designed specifically for users who want advanced features and complete control over their browsing experience

## Pricing

Vivaldi is completely free with no paid tiers or premium features. All functionality including the email client, calendar, feed reader, advanced customization options, and privacy features are available at no cost. The company generates revenue through search engine partnerships and affiliate commissions from bookmark recommendations, ensuring the browser remains free for all users without compromising privacy.

The integrated Proton VPN offers free access with medium speeds and servers in five countries, with optional paid upgrades available directly through Proton for users who need additional VPN features like higher speeds and access to all server locations.

## Ideal For

Vivaldi is perfect for power users who demand extensive customization and built-in productivity tools without compromising privacy. The browser excels for professionals who work with multiple projects simultaneously, researchers who need advanced tab management and note-taking capabilities, and privacy-conscious users seeking a European alternative to Big Tech browsers.

The browser is particularly well-suited for users migrating from older versions of Opera who miss the extensive feature set, developers and web professionals who need built-in tools and customization options, and anyone who prefers a unified workspace combining browsing, email, calendar, and news reading. Small businesses and teams benefit from Vivaldi's productivity features and the ability to maintain separate user profiles on shared installations.

Given its Norwegian origins and employee-owned structure, Vivaldi is ideal for users who want to support European technology companies that prioritize user rights over corporate profits.
