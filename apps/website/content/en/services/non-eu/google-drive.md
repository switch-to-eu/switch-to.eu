Google Drive is a cloud storage service developed by Google that allows users to store files, synchronize files across devices, and share files with others. It integrates with Google's productivity suite including Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides.


## Privacy and Security

While Google Drive offers convenient storage and collaboration features, it's operated by Google, which has a business model centered around data collection and advertising. Google Drive is based in the United States and is subject to U.S. data regulations rather than exclusively following EU privacy standards.

## Data Concerns

- Google can scan and analyze your stored content
- Data is stored primarily on U.S. servers
- Subject to U.S. surveillance laws
- Google's privacy policy allows for data collection and analysis
- Data may be used for personalization and targeted advertising
- May not fully comply with EU data sovereignty requirements
