WhatsApp is a widely used messaging application owned by Meta (formerly Facebook). While it offers end-to-end encryption for messages, it's based in the United States and subject to U.S. data regulations rather than GDPR.

## Privacy and Security

While WhatsApp does provide end-to-end encryption for messages, it's owned by Meta (Facebook), a company with a controversial track record regarding user privacy. WhatsApp collects metadata about your usage and has previously shared this data with its parent company.

## Data Concerns

- Collects and may share metadata with Meta/Facebook
- Based in the United States, outside EU jurisdiction
- Not fully compliant with GDPR standards
- Subject to U.S. surveillance laws
- User data can potentially be used for ad targeting within the Meta ecosystem
